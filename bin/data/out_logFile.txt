Here is some information about the guest speaker for the Data Viz class that is coming by on Thursday night  His name is and he will be at ITP tomorrow at 7 30 in speaking in the adjunct office  I   

I hope you get a chance to go and enjoy  I'm pal on stopping by the quantified self meetup so I'll be missing this one

These components suck  They are so
extremely 
onto a boards unless you have a specialized designed board  I have ruined three of these due to 
types of u issues Unlike other components that you can solder a  and      and then desolder for  They need to be soldered onto 
in other    
to work   but they    headers easily rip off taking 
them the connective ma  materials    area                                    and take the connective parts of the component 
you better get these right the first time - otherwise you'll have to 
out another 20 dollars
I strongly
wish someone would create a solution that has
is easier to work with      
you a have
are have expert soldering abilities I would look somewhere else     for this

Heart Rate Monitoring
Testing 
After having gone through three separate Polar Heart Rate Monitors I 
decide 
use the
heart rate monitor
Heart Rate Monitor Interface 
ruined 
my experience
attempting to solder the
Polar Heart Rate receiver
was not designed
has a very sensitive
is very fragile
hard to integrate into prototype circuit
least for someone with my level of soldering and desoldering expertise
In order to use the Polar Heart Rate
Rate Monitor Interface 
decide to
leverage I2c
rather than serial protocol
I made this decision so that I could
in order
so that I could use 
serial port from my arduino 
to log data

approaches to data reading 
Creating an object for that include 
at holds each
all fields for any given entry
Creating an object that holds all entries for a given field 
The first approach enables you
is more effective but more limiting
because you can customize the data  type that is holding the information to the
the specific needs of you
your application 
The second approach provides a bit more flexibility in that you can create a generic "field" data type which can be used to read data that has different numbers of fields  Therefore
when you have data that may shift
if you want to use the same application for different types
data that is similarly
you want to display in a similar manner but that my ay vary this is a good approach to take
When you have full control of your data and you want to have                     have the 
and are willing to do the extra customization required for this approach I recommend doing this 
this way          
Current project as an example that features both of these approaches  The first approach is used to manage the activity data   where   ile the second approach is used to mang age the main data

Activity Activity Data
One benefit of the field 
class approach is that if you are trying to compare
find out which is the peak a
at are the at   peaks and valleys in the data you can keep all of this calculation within the field object itself  When the objects are created for each entry then this type of calculation has to be done in
outside of the objects though this is not necessary
a big drawback  
The more programming I do
the more I am coming to understand the importance of the structure or information 
architecture
of the applications that I build I have never doubted that this was true especially after working for many years doing marketing for large corporations such as
technology companies such as IBM Microsoft and HP however I n know I have a first hand understanding of how this is so
